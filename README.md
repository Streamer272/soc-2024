# Hello!

Welcome, you either don't know what the hell this is or know exactly what the hell this is. Either way, here's a quick
explanation:

I decided to write a special paper at my highschool - why? It's kind of a competition, a bunch of students submit their
SOC paper and the best one wins. They're actually graded by a whole ahh comittee and it's a big deal and whatever.
Anyway, I'm here cuz it's fun, not cuz I wanna win (obviously I wanna win but that's not why I decided to do the SOC)

I will eventually (probably Feb 2025) publish the paper, which I will also send to everyone who participated in the
survey (fr thanks to everyone who did). Here I wanna keep all the scripts I used while writing the paper, it's mostly
stuff for cleaning, analyzing, and graphing the dataset

I will also probably send out a link to this repo along with the paper, so if you got here from that link, welcome!
Thanks so much for participating in the survey, you can check out the scripts and the other markdowns (to be added)
where I explain what I did in a slightly more friendly way

And if you're interested in the dataset, no I'm not publishing it, sorry (mom said no)

### Dataset
